== Introduction

The purpose of the Data Management Handbook (DMH) is threefold:

1. to provide an overview of the principles for data management to be employed.
2. to help personnel identify their roles and responsibilities for good data management.
3. to provide personnel with practical guidelines for carrying out good data management.

_Data management_ is the term used to describe the handling of data in a systematic and cost-effective manner. 
The data management regime should be continuously evolving, to reflect the evolving nature of data colletion. Therefore this DMH is a living document that will be revised and updated from time to time in order to maintain its relevance.

The DMH is a strategic governing document and should be used as part of the quality framework the organisation is using. 

// Remember to add links/references to the chapters below

This DMH focuses on the management of geophysical data, types of data and the usage of these data are described in the organisation specific information in Section X.X.X.
This introduction (Chapter 1) lays forth the background and principles for the data management regime. 
Chapters 2-5 describe the implementation of the main building blocks: structuring and documenting data (Chapter 2), data services (Chapter 3), portals and documentation aimed at users (Chapter 4) and governance issues (Chapter 5). 
Each chapter starts with a brief statement of its purpose, followed by a description of what is implemented at the organisation at present, as well as the planned developments for the short-term (<2 years) and expected developments for the longer term (2-5 years). 
Practical guidelines for carrying out good data management are addressed in Chapter 6 and especially in the Quick Manual for Data Providers. 
The Quick Manual is a concise, informal HOW-TO for data management practitioners.

The intended audience for this DMH is any co-worker who is involved in any part of the value chain for geophysical data (<<img-value_chain>>).

The handbook can be used in three ways: 

1. Read the Introduction (Chapter 1) to find out the background and principles of data management;
2. Read Chapters 2-5 to learn about how data management is currently implemented and how it is expected to evolve in the next few years:
3. Go to the Quick Manual for Data Providers for guidelines on what to do in real-life cases; alternatively Chapter 6 for typical workflow examples.
