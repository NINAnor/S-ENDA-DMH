== Appendix B: Users of MET Norway’s Geodata

//this list is currently METNorway specific. Should perhaps be split in software and services from S-EnDA (general) and a partner specific part. 
// when the general part of the document is finished, check where these are referenced.
//Todo: add links


Users are divided into categories by type of collaboration with MET, not by type of service they consume.
